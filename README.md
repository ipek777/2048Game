# 2048 GAME

A 2048 game I have created for my Introduction to Programming (Practicum) course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University.

## How to play 2048?

The game is played by moving tiles on a grid. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. The object of the game is to reach 2048 by merging the tiles together. The game ends when the board runs out of free space - Losing. The player could stop playing once they reach the 2048 tile - Winning, or continue to play to get even bigger numbers!

My code for the game also includes: 
-
- a gameboard with custom dimensions;
- a Leaderboard functionality, which tracks the top 5 scores and nicknames of the players with those scores, for each dimension of the gameboard.
